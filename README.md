This repository contains materials for a hands-on lab session that is part of a course on **Data Assimilation**. The goal is to discover how neural networks can be designed to emulate and learn the dynamics of chaotic systemsâ€”especially when informed by physical structure or numerical integration methods.

We experiment with three types of models:

* **NaiveNetwork**: a basic multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
* **ConvolutionalNetwork**: a spatially-aware model using Conv1D
* **HybridNetwork**: a physics-informed architecture with Runge-Kutta integration
